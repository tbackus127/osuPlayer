## osu! Music Player

This project will (when finished) be able to simply be ran inside the main directory for the rhythm game 'osu!'.
It will choose a random beatmap and display its background, song title, artist, and source by parsing the beatmap file.
Along with a map's metadata, it will feature a spectrum visualization, song progress bar, and perhaps even storyboard/video rendering.
